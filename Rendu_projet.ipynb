    "The local path planner is based on a potential field, where the goal is attractive and the obstacles repulsive. This enables a very general approach to avoid obstacles that were not detected by the global path planner beforehand in all kinds of scenarios. The target of the local path planner corresponds to the Thymioâ€™s next waypoint which is computed and provided by the global path planner. The goal first must be transformed into the robotâ€™s reference frame since the latter differs from the global one (see figure below). Only then, the potential fields of the obstacles and the goal can be generated and summed up.\n",

    "\n",
    "The limitation of using a potential field approach with this robot is that every sensor only provides a measurement of a point in space, potentially resulting in a field that will guide the robot through two detected points even if those two points are part of the same obstacle and, hence blocking that path. To avoid this scenario, we assume that all detected points are part of the same obstacle and inflate them to create a continuous obstacle, removing the gap between the points. To do so, we make use of Bresenhamâ€™s algorithm which computes the points on our 2-dimensional raster that approximate the best a straight line between the two detected points.\n",
